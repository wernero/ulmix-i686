		*** ULMIX Operating System ***

The ULMIX Operating System wants to be a Unix-like operating system with
advanced memory management features and preemtive multitasking. It's currently
under heavy development but getting more stable very fast.

Userspace and Kernel currently have to be compiled seperatly. To build everything, run 'make' both in the tree root directory and in the userspace directory.

kernel/		contains kernel sources
userspace/	contains C library and a few userspace tools
diskimage/	contains a makefile for building a disk image
drivers/	contains driver-modules (not yet dynamically loadable)
launch.sh	will launch qemu with well tested configuration and print
		serial output to the terminal.
vmulmix		is the kernel image in raw format (flat binary)
vmulmix.elf	is the kernel image in ELF format (for grub or qemu -kernel)

To start Ulmix with qemu, use the following command:
$ qemu-system-i386 -kernel vmulmix.elf -drive format=raw,file=diskimage/hdd.img

If you want to start qemu with the serial output redirected into a file, do
the following:
$ qemu-system-i386 -kernel vmulmix.elf -drive format=raw,file=diskimage/hdd.img -serial file:ser.txt

To boot via grub:
$ qemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=diskimage/hdd.img

It currently supports the i386 architecture (32bit x86) and has the following
features:

- Virtual Address Spaces using paging
- Preemtive Multitasking with Processes and Threads
- ATA HDD driver (currently operating in port IO mode)
- Virtual file system
- Ext2 filesystem support (currently read-only)
- C library providing basic functionality, linux-compatible
