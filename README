		*** ULMIX Operating System ***

The ULMIX Operating System wants to become a Unix-like operating system with
advanced memory management features and preemtive multitasking. It's currently
under heavy development and a little far from stable.

Currently the ULMIX Operating System uses the bootloader of the PrettyOS
project (http://www.prettyos.de). However, a custom bootloader that has ext2
support is planned.

-> Compile with 'make all'. Note that this uses the mount(1) command to copy
the files to an image file and thus requres root permissions. The makefile
will generate debug symbols and write them into the bochs.symbols file, which
can then be accessed via the bochs debugger. The core kernel source files are
contained in the 'kernel' directory.

To start Ulmix with qemu, use the following command:
$ qemu-system-i386 -kernel vmulmix.elf -hda diskimage/hdd.img

If you want to start qemu with the serial output redirected into a file, do
the following:
$ qemu-system-i386 -kernel vmulmix.elf -hda diskimage/hdd.img -serial file:ser.txt

To compile, you should be under a Unix-like environment and have the binutils
and nasm programs installed.

It currently supports the i386 architecture (32bit x86) and has the following
features:

- Virtual Address Spaces using paging
- Preemtive Multitasking with Processes and Threads
- ATA HDD driver
- Extensive Virtual File System (under development)
- Ext2 filesystem support (under development)

Features that are to be added:
- Userspace C Library
- Task prioritization
- Bash port
- GCC port
- Sound driver
- USB driver
- Graphics card driver
